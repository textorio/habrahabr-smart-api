This is a read-only source software.

You can read its source and build it for yourself (and only for yourself).
But you can't fork it, publicly modify it, distribute it (with the exception of pull-requests to this repository or discussions in the mailing lists, forums, Facebook and other communication platforms).
Moreover you can't use it in any kind of project except of this project, especially commercial things.

In the future we may (and probably will) change this to Apache License 2 or Affero GPL 3, but that's not decided yet. It's a read-only for now.
